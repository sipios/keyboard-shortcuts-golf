# First Exercise
Class `MatricialInsightUtils` has a method `itemsToInsightList` which contains duplication.

The pair of `if` blocks have the same structure and should be factorized.

Your mission is to factorize this code
- do not change public method signature
- do not breaking anything (tests must stay green ðŸŸ¢)
- do not use the mouse
- use the least possible refactoring actions.

The expected result can be found in branch `refactored`.
